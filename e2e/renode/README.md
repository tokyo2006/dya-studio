# WebSerial ⇄ Renode end-to-end (POC)

Run the **real dya-studio** in a headless browser and have it **fully connect** to
**real ZMK firmware** running in the [Renode](https://renode.io) emulator over the
**WebSerial** API — with no hardware, in CI.

## What this proves

The built dya-studio app, in headless Chromium, using the real
`@zmkfirmware/zmk-studio-ts-client` serial transport (unchanged), completes its
full Studio connect handshake against real firmware emulated in Renode and reaches
the **connected screen** (the device's own name appears in the app header). The
DUT is the exact hardware-flashable `studio-rpc-usb-uart` image; its Studio RPC
rides the **emulated USB CDC-ACM**, so it is the same transport class the browser
uses on real hardware.

```
dya-studio (dist, headless Chromium)
   │  navigator.serial  ← injected shim: real API surface, ts-client unchanged
   ▼  WebSocket
bridge.mjs (Node)  ──raw TCP (transparent bytes)──▶  renode_serve.py relay
                                                          │  (Studio CDC bytes)
                                    DualCdcAcmBridge USB host ⇄ NRF_USBD_Full
                                                          │
                                                   real ZMK fw.elf in Renode
```

Everything except the browser↔OS serial-driver layer is real: the app, the
transport, the RPC/protobuf framing, and the firmware. Only the last-mile serial
driver is replaced by a WebSocket — there is no serial device in CI anyway.

## Why USB CDC (and what changed)

An earlier version of this POC carried Studio RPC over a **UART** TCP socket and
could only assert a bare `GetDeviceInfo`: Renode's nRF52840 **UARTE TX-IRQ model
stalls partway through any Studio reply of ~≥30 framed bytes**, and the app's full
connect fetches replies far larger than that, so the UI never reached the
connected screen.

zmk-west-commands' **usb mode** (NRF_USBD_Full + DualCdcAcmBridge) has no such
limit — it drains large device→host bursts — so this POC now boots the exact
hardware-flashable `studio-rpc-usb-uart` image and asserts the app reaches the
**fully-connected** screen. `renode_serve.py` attaches the USB CDC bridge via the
zmk-west-commands harness and relays the Studio CDC byte stream over a plain TCP
socket (`RPC_PORT`) that the Node bridge speaks to, unchanged.

## Run locally

```bash
# prerequisites:
#   - Renode 1.16.1 at ~/.renode/1.16.1
#   - a checkout of cormoran/zmk-west-commands (for the Renode harness)
#   - a built dist/ (npm run build at the repo root)
#   - a real studio-rpc-usb-uart DUT ELF. Build one from zmk-west-commands:
#       west init -l . --mf scripts/west-test-standalone.yml
#       west update --narrow && west zephyr-export
#       west zmk-build tests/zmk-config --build-yaml tests/zmk-config/build-ble.yaml -af ble -d build
#     -> build/ble/zephyr/zmk.elf (advertises the name "Renode")
cd e2e/renode
npm install && npx playwright install chromium
ZMK_WC_RENODE_LIB=/path/to/zmk-west-commands/scripts/lib/renode \
DEVICE_NAME=Renode \
  bash run-local.sh /path/to/build/ble/zephyr/zmk.elf
POC_DEBUG=1 ...   # verbose page/shim/bridge byte logging
```

CI wiring lives in `.github/workflows/renode-webserial-e2e.yml` (builds the real
DUT from zmk-west-commands' fixtures, then runs this). To point at a real dya
keyboard, build its own `studio-rpc-usb-uart` firmware and set `DEVICE_NAME` to
its keyboard name.

## Toward the real flashable image over a real OS serial port (next step)

This POC drives the DUT's USB CDC through Renode's in-emulator DualCdcAcmBridge and
relays it to the browser over a WebSocket shim. The last fidelity step would be to
export that emulated USB device to the host OS as a real `/dev/ttyACM*` (e.g. via
USB/IP) so an **unshimmed** `navigator.serial` opens it — removing the shim
entirely. That is a zmk-west-commands concern and is untested here.
