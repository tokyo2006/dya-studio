/**
 * StudioUnlockContext — the single, app-wide gate for "the keyboard is locked".
 *
 * Every feature routes its device requests through {@link useStudioUnlock}'s
 * `runWithUnlock`. When a request fails with a Studio-unlock error the failed
 * operation is *parked* and the shared {@link UnlockPrompt} modal opens; once
 * the user unlocks (auto-detected via `lockStateChanged`, or by clicking Retry)
 * the parked operation is retried and its original promise resolves with the
 * real result — so the caller sees a single awaited call that "just works"
 * after the unlock detour.
 *
 * `requireUnlock` is the proactive counterpart used by editor pages: it opens
 * the same modal *before* sending a doomed request when Studio is already known
 * to be locked. Callers may hand it an `onUnlocked` callback — the action the
 * user was trying to take (open the keycode selector, apply the edit, …) — and
 * it is *parked* just like a failed request: once the user unlocks, the action
 * runs, so a locked click resumes into what it was going to do instead of being
 * silently dropped.
 *
 * Cancel cooldown: after the user dismisses the modal, further unlock errors
 * are auto-cancelled (no modal) until every unlock-gated request has finished
 * *and* things have stayed quiet for {@link DEFAULT_QUIET_MS}. This keeps a load
 * that fans out into several RPCs — some of which may take a while — from
 * immediately re-popping the modal the user just closed: as long as requests
 * keep arriving the quiet timer restarts, so suppression lasts until the burst
 * settles. An actual unlock clears it.
